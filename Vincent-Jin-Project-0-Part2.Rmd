# Self Introduction
## Background

```{r Background, echo = FALSE}
cat("Hi! My name is Vincent Jin and I am a second year MHS student from the Department of Epidemiology, Infectious Disease track.")

cat("I completed my bachelor's degree from Unviersity of Washington with a major of Public Health in 2019. Before I came to Hopkins, I worked as a social worker who helps senior low-English-literacy Asian immigrants access governmental healthcare programs in Seattle, WA for about 1 and a half year.")

cat("My current research interest lies upon the COVID-19 pandemic. \nI am currently doing a survival analysis to try explore the association between prior COVID-19 infections before vaccination and breakthrough infections after being fully vaccinated.")

cat("I do not have much experiences with coding and do not know much about R. Before this course, I was mainly using Stata on data analysis. I also do not have very strong statistical background, but I think I'll be able to satisfy the requirements of this course that were described in Lecture 01. By taking this course, I wish to familiarize myself with R so that I'll be having more options when doing data analysis in the future, and also expand my capability of collaboration with colleagues who only use R.")

cat("Thank you so much for this course, Dr. Hicks! I have already learned a lot by doing the Project 0. Looking forward to hear more about R and Statistical Computing!")
